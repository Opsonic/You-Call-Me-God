God is sat, listening to prayers playing through a contraption. Eventually a sythentic voice anounces his inbox is full, so God sighs and picks the phone sitting by his side.
His voice slowly goes cold, the camera is tightly wrapped round his expression. The scene fades to him staring in the mirror with the same face. He turns round as the scene fades to black.
